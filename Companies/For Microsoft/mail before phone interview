Omid,

 

Greetings and congratulations!

 

Welcome to the next phase of your employment application with Microsoft.  I would like to introduce you to Gerardo Bodegas Martinez, the hiring leader for this team.  He would like to conduct a one hour phone interview with you which will be a technical screen.  It will attempt to determine if you meet the requirements for the position.  If the technical requirements are met, you will be cleared for the remainder of the interview process.

 

The screen may be conducted by one or more Microsoft engineers from the hiring team.  It may not necessarily take an entire hour to complete.  You will need access to a computer with an internet connection as you may be asked to demonstrate your technical qualifications in real-time.  If you are applying for a software engineering position this could include live coding.

 

Depending on the position you are applying for, the technical screen may include some or all of the following topics:

    Software development and/or Design
    Problem Solving
    Project management
    Technical systems engineering

 

Please “reply-all” to this email, and provide:

    Dates and times over the next two weeks when you can be available for this one hour interview
    Your time zone (note that your interviewers are likely to be U.S. Pacific Time)
    A phone number where you can be reached

 

Thank you for your interest in the position.  We look forward to speaking with you soon.

 

Highest Regards,

 

Chrissy Mendoza Greenleaf
