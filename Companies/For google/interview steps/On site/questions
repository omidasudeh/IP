med 4. Indain Guy:given two sets of intervals return the intersection set.
med 3. Adam: given a list of votes {id, timestamp} and a threshold n return the set of votes greater than n in the last hour.
hard 2. Mohammad: given a string and a big street screen what is the largest possible font that can be printed on the screen. screen can have multiple lines. we have two functions that return height and width of each char given a font.
easy 1. Red: evaluate "1+2-4+7"

========
1. the first one I worte the solution. ==> I guess myscore is: 80/100
2. I got the algorithm but was not able to code it appropriately, probably he will get negative feedback on the coding side. I asked him what do you love about google and he responded "that I work with smart people" 60/100
3. first I gave a simple solution but I realized that it was not OK. I had problem with the concept of timing. I could not underestand how to handle the concept of last hour. The interviewer tried hard to give me hints but I was not able to get it, I was feeling jetlag and numb! 60/100
4. I wrote the bruteforce solution. He asked me to prove something but I was not able to. I could not improve the solution. 70/100

my guess overall score: (80+60+60+70)/4 = 270/4= 67.5
