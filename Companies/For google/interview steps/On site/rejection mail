Hi Omid,

I wanted to reach out and personally thank you so much for taking the time to interview with and visit us on campus! While I wish I had better news, I hope that we can stay in touch and chat again in the future for new roles. As discussed on the phone, the committee has decided not to move forward with your candidacy for the Software Engineer role. However, please note that a member of my team may reach out to you if they come across another role that we think would be a strong match for you.

I know from personal experience it can be disappointing to not be selected to continue on in the interview process but I hope you maintain your passion for computer science and that I hear from you again in the future!

It's been a pleasure working with you and I appreciate the investment you made in interviewing with Google. I wish you the best in your search and hope you have an amazing rest of your summer! Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me if you have questions. Take care!

Best,
Allyssa
