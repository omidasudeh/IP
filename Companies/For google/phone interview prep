focus: coding, algorithms, and data structures space and time complexity, system design , oop
types of Qs: 
coding => efficient code in short time is the key. 
design => work with the interviewer to creat a high-level system
general analysis => show that you understand all asapects of the problem, offer multiple solutions
* they want to know if they are confortable to work with you.

======= Prep
coding,oop,corner cases
algorithm time/space analysis, A* dijekstra
Testing => want are good testcases
data structure : as much as possible
know some NP complete problem knap sack, tSP
math => counting problem. k choose n. probability
OS => general review some OS stuff
System design ?

find problem, write code, solve them
======= during interview
explain and clarify
questions are intentionally is vauge ask questions
keep thinking. improve the solution
