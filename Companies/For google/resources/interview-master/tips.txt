1. Remember to check the boundary. This can also be done to add an outer space to ease the checking effort.
2. Recursive thinking. f(n) = f(n - 1)... ?
3. Sort first helps.
4. Consider all of the input possibilities: empty string, the same length, positive or negtive intergers, what's the input type? float or int or positives, etc.
5. Consider the boundary of the input integers, whether they will exceed the INT_MAX or INT_MIN.
6. Remember to reuse the information you have calculated.
7. Be careful of the scope of the variables and the initialization.
8. Consider the head bit added due to the carrier.
9. The logic of solving problems is to separating into small problems with a good difinition of classification.
10. Clarify procedures and functions.
