    X 0. instantiate a BST
    X 1. build a BST from an array
        - expect null if array is null
        - expect null if array size <= 0
    X 2. find
        - Expect NULL if empty tree
        - Expect NULL if not found
        - Expect k  == find(k)->key
    X 3. Insert a key into BST
        Insert some elements and for all key k:
        - Expect k  == find(k)->key
    X 4. Delete a key from BST
        - Delete leaf
        - Delete node with one subtree
        - Delete node with both subtrees
        for all Deleted key k:
        - Expect null  == find(k)->key
    X 5. successor
        compute successor for all nodes of the tree and compare it with the actual value
